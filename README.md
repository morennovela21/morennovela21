# Hi there 👋

**`Being an Accounting degree to Web Developer`**

With an Accounting degree, I already developed strong numeral and quantitative skills, with analytical and problem-solving capabilities. My accounting background can be particularly useful to switch careers to become a Web Developer who is passionate about everything that goes into building and developing web portals.
